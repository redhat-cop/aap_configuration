bugfixes:
  - When exporting job templates it was failing when missing some input information.
  - "When importing the exported settings, fields like `AUTOMATION_ANALYTICS_LAST_GATHER: 2023-07-17T13:22:06.445818Z` caused problems with the multiple `:`."
  - When importing the exported notification templates, the types of some values are not as expected.
  - When exporting schedules, the diff_mode was not treated correctly
  - Temporarily fixed an error when installing docker-compose using pip (see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76708329/docker-compose-no-longer-building-image-attributeerror-cython-sources for more information)
